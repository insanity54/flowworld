## Gamification

Flow World is not a game. It is a celebration of collective presence rather than competition. "Your presence itself is the reward."



### Impermanence as a Feature 

There are no logins or identies on flow world, only Bindu. This Bindu is a drop of your awareness, fleeting and radiant.

* [ ] Bindu gain 1 effort Point per every pose present (numbers are hidden from UI)
* [ ] lotus flower grows and glows with points
* [ ] Bindu vanish when reaching 1000 points

### Compassion and Connection

* [ ] You can send send “metta” (loving-kindness) to others.


### Humility

* [ ] The app explicitly avoids rankings to cultivate humility and inclusivity.

### Phrases

* [ ] Our practice is not isolated; it’s part of a web of compassion and awakening.
* [ ] Achievements are gifts, not just personal accomplishments.
