/* CONCEPT */

Flow World is a multiplayer yoga experiment.
A mystical space where everyone on Earth holds the same pose together—one minute at a time.

No logins.
No usernames.
No ego.
Just movement and presence.

Chat is optional.
Music is ambient.
Avatar is gentle.

Come as you are.

/* INSPIRATION */

Started with daily stretches in 2019.
Inspired by YouTube yoga, but craving connection.
Too shy for in-person classes—so I made my own global one.
This is the middle ground.
